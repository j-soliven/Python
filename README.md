# Python
This repo holds my code from self-teaching Python through the "Python Crash Course" book.

## Focus
This repo focuses on learning syntax and other functions within python. These will be labeled as chapters.

## What's next?
After finishing the 10 chapters within the book, I will move on to working on the 3 projects outlined in Part 2 of the book
- Simple Game Development using Classes
- Data Visualization
- Basic Web Apps using Django

Then I will move on to Automate the Boring Stuff book found [here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
